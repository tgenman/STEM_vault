- A set $S$ is made up of elements, and if $a$ is one of these elements, we shall denote this fact by $a ∈ S$.
- There is exactly one set with no elements. It is the [[Empty Set|empty set]]  and is denoted by $∅$
- $\set{2,4,6,8} = \set{x|x \text{ is an even whole positive number ≤ 8}} = \set{2x|x = 1,2,3,4}$
	- The notation $\set{x | P(x)}$ is often called “set-builder notation.”
- A set is ==well defined==, meaning that if $S$ is a set and a is some object, then either $a$ is definitely in $S$, denoted by $a ∈ S$, or $a$ is definitely not in $S$, denoted by $a \not\in S$. 
	- Thus, we should never say, “Consider the set $S$ of some positive numbers,”
- Элементы в записи множества не должны повторяться.


Множества бывают **конечными** (состоящими из конечного числа элементов) и **бесконечными** (из бесконечного числа элементов). Отличить их можно по записи.
