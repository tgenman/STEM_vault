$$
f^{-1}(f(x)) = f(f^{-1}(x))
$$

An **inverse function** undoes the work of another function

In a function's inverse, the input and output values are swapped. For example, if the point (3,5) is on the graph of a function, the point (5,3) will be on the graph of the inverse.

Functions are considered to be ==**invertible**== if their inverses are also functions
