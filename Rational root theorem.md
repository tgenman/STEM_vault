The fundamental theorem of algebra says that **every** degree-n polynomial with complex coefficients (note: this includes polynomials with real coefficients, since every real number is a complex number) has n **complex** roots (assuming each root is counted according to its multiplicity).

**every** odd-degree polynomial with real coefficients has at least one real root.
