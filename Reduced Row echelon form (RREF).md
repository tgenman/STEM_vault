A matrix is in _row echelon form_ if:
1. All zero rows are at the bottom.
2. The first nonzero entry of a row is to the _right_ of the first nonzero entry of the row above.
3. Below the first nonzero entry of a row, all entries are zero.

A _pivot_ is the first nonzero entry of a row of a matrix in row echelon form.

A matrix is in _reduced row echelon form_ if it is in row echelon form, and in addition:
4. Each pivot is equal to 1.
5. Each pivot is the only nonzero entry in its column.
