A **sequence** is an ordered list of objects such as numbers.

Most sequences can be described in any of these three ways:

-   **By property**: Define the sequence as the set of all numbers that have some property, ordered by another property — for example, “the first 7 positive odd numbers ordered from least to greatest.”
-   **Recursively**: Give the first term and explain how to go from one term to the next — for example, “the first term in the sequence is 1, and then we add 2 to go from one term to the next, 6 times.”
-   **Explicitly**: Give an equation to calculate the nth value in the sequence — for example, “the nthnth term in the sequence is equal to 2n−1 up to n=7.”
