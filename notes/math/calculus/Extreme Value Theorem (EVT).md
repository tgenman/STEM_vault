Suppose  is continuous at every point in an interval  

The Extreme Value Theorem says that $f$ takes on a maximum value and a minimum value.

In other words, there is at least one point $p$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(p)\geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, and there is at least one point $q$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(q)\leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b].$
