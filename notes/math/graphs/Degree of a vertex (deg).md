### Definition
> [!tip] Degree of a vertex $v$ in a graph $G$
 - is the number of vertices that are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] to $v$. 
 - is the number of vertices in its [[Neighbourhood in graph (N)|neighborhood]] $N(v)$. 
 - is the number of edges incident with $v$.

$$\deg v = |N(v)|$$
### Types vertex by degree
- $\deg v = 0$ - [[Isolated vertex]]
- $\deg v = 1$ - [[End-vertex]]
- [[Even and Odd Vertices]]
    - [[Number of odd vertices]]

### Types degree in graph
- [[Maximum degree ∆(G)]]
- [[Minimum degree δ(G)]]


$$0 ≤ δ(G) ≤ \deg v ≤ ∆(G) ≤ n − 1$$

Not exist a [[Simple Graph (G)|graph]]  where all nodes have different degrees.
