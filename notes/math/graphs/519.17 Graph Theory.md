A nontrivial closed walk in a graph G in which no edge is repeated is a circuit in G. 
For example,
$$C = (u,w,x,y,w,v,u)$$

A circuit $C = (v = v0,v1,...,vk = v)$ $k ≥ 2$, for which the vertices $v_i$, $0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1$, are distinct is a cycle in $G$.

A cycle of even length is an even cycle, while a cycle of odd length is an odd cycle
[[Cycle graph (C_n)]]

The length of a smallest cycle in a graph G (containing cycles) is the girth of G, denoted by g(G),

the length of a longest cycle is the circumference of G, denoted by c(G).

Two vertices u and v in a graph G are connected if G contains a u − v path.

The graph G itself is connected if every two vertices of G are connected.

A connected subgraph H of a graph G is a component of G if H is not a proper subgraph of any connected subgraph of G. 
Thus, every component of G is an induced subgraph of G.
The number of components in a graph G is denoted by k(G)
Therefore, G is connected if and only if k(G) = 1
