A set system is an ordered pair $(V,F)$, where $V$ is a set of elements and $F$ is a family of subsets of $V$ . 

The elements of $V$ are then called the ==vertices of the hypergraph==,
and the elements of $F$ its edges or ==hyperedges==.

A hypergraph is $k$-uniform if each edge is a $k$-set (a set of $k$ elements). 

Set systems give rise to graphs in two principal ways: 
- [[Incidence graphs]]
- [[Intersection graphs]]

Many interesting examples of hypergraphs are provided by geometric configurations. 
A geometric configuration $(P,L)$ consists of a finite set $P$ of elements called ==points==, and a finite family $L$ of subsets of $P$ called ==lines==, with the property that at most one line contains any given pair of points. 

Two classical examples of geometric configurations are the ==Fano plane== and the ==Desargues configuration==. These two configurations are shown in Figure 1.15. 
In both cases, each line consists of three points. 
These configurations thus give rise to 3-uniform hypergraphs; 
the ==Fano hypergraph== has seven vertices and seven edges, 
the ==Desargues hypergraph== ten vertices and ten edges.
