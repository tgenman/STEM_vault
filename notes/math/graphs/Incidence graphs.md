A natural graph associated with a set system $H = (V,F)$ is the bipartite graph $G[V,F]$, where $v ∈ V$ and $F ∈ F$ are adjacent if $v ∈ F$. 

This bipartite graph $G$ is called the incidence graph of the set system $H$, and the bipartite adjacency matrix of $G$ the incidence matrix of H; these are simply alternative ways of representing a set system. Incidence graphs of geometric configurations often give rise to interesting bipartite graphs; in this context, the incidence graph is sometimes called the Levi graph of the configuration. The incidence graph of the Fano plane is shown in Figure 1.16. 

This graph is known as the ==Heawood graph==.
