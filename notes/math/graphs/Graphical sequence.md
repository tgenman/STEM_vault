> [!tip] Graphical sequence
is a finite sequence ${} s {}$ of nonnegative integers
if ${} s$ is a [[Degree Sequence|degree sequence]]  of some graph.

While the conditions that ${} d_i ≤ n − 1 {}$ for all $i (1 ≤ i ≤ n)$ and ${} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \deg v_i {}$ is even are necessary for s to be graphical, they are not sufficient.

It is not all that unusual for a graphical sequence to be the degree sequence of more than one graph.
