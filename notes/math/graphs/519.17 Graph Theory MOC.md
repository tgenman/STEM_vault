An eigenvalue of a graph is an eigenvalue of its [[Adjacency matrix|adjacency matrix]]. 
Likewise, the characteristic polynomial of a graph is the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix.

A nontrivial closed walk in a graph G in which no edge is repeated is a circuit in G. 
For example,
$$C = (u,w,x,y,w,v,u)$$

A circuit $C = (v = v0,v1,...,vk = v)$ $k ≥ 2$, for which the vertices $v_i$, $0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1$, are distinct is a cycle in $G$.

Two vertices u and v in a graph G are connected if G contains a u − v path.

The graph G itself is connected if every two vertices of G are connected.

A connected subgraph H of a graph G is a component of G if H is not a proper subgraph of any connected subgraph of G. 
Thus, every component of G is an induced subgraph of G.
The number of components in a graph G is denoted by k(G)
Therefore, G is connected if and only if k(G) = 1
