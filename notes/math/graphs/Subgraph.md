> [!tip] A graph $H$ is a subgraph of a graph $G$
if $V(H)⊆V(G)$ and $E(H)⊆E(G)$
in which case we write $H ⊆ G$.

> [!tip] Supergraph
If $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, then $G$ is a supergraph of $H$.

> [!tip] Proper subgraph
If $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ where $H\not\cong G$ ([[519.175.1 Isomorphic Graphs|isomorph]]), then $H$ is a proper subgraph of $G$.
