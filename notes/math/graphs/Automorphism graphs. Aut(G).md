> [!tip] Automorphism $Aut(G)$
> is an [[519.175.1 Isomorphic Graphs|isomorphism]] of the graph to itself.

The automorphisms of a graph reflect its [[Symmetry|symmetries]].

> [!tip] Vertex-transitive (symmetric) graph
Graphs in which all vertices are similar, such as (called):
- the [[Complete graph|complete graph]]  $K_n$, 
- the [[Complete bipartite graph|complete bipartite graph]] $K_{n,n}$
- the [[The Petersen Graph|n-cube]]  $Q_n$, 

> [!tip] Asymmetric graphs
graphs in which no two vertices are similar

We denote the set of all automorphisms of a graph $G$ by $Aut(G)$, and their number by $aut(G)$. 
$Aut(G)$ is a [[Group|group]] under the operation of composition
