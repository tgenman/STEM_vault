> [!tip] A graph $G$ is bipartite 
if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into two sets $U$ and $W$ (called partite sets) so that every  [[Edge of graph (E)|edge]] of $G$ joins a [[Vertex of graph (V)|vertex]]  of $U$ and a vertex of $W$

typical bipartite graphs:
- [[Path graph (P_n)]]
- even order [[Cycle graph (C_n)]]


Therefore, from [[Theorem about max size of bipartite graph]] and [[Theorem about triangle in graph]], it follows that every graph of order $n ≥ 3$ and size $m > ⌊\frac{n^2}{4}⌋$ not only fails to be ==bipartite==, it must, in fact, contain a [[Triangle]].
