> [!tip] Degree sequence of a graph $G$ of order $n$ 
A sequence $d_1, d_2, . . . , d_n$ of nonnegative integers
if the vertices of $G$ can be labeled $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ so that $\deg v_i = d_i$ for $1 ≤ i ≤ n$.

For example, a degree sequence of the graph $G$  is $4,3,2,2,1$ (or $1,2,2,3,4$ or $2,1,4,2,3$, etc.).

We commonly write the degree sequence of a graph as a nonincreasing sequence.
