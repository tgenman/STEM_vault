> [!tip] The $n$-cube $Q_n$ (hypercube)
is $K_2$ if $n = 1$, 
while for $n ≥ 2$, $Q_n$ is defined recursively as the [[Cartesian product of sets (A x B)]] $Q_{n−1} \square K_2$ . 

The n-cube can also be defined as that graph whose vertex set is the set of ordered n-tuples $(a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n)$ or $a_1a_2 ···a_n$ where $a_i$ is $0$ or $1$ for $1 ≤ i ≤ n$ (commonly called $n$-bit strings), such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding ordered $n$-tuples differ at precisely one coordinate. 

The graph $Q_n$ is an $n$-regular graph of order $2^n$.
