> [!tip] A complete $k$-partite graph $G$ 
is a $k$[[Multipartite Graphs|-partite graph]] with the property that two vertices are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in $G$ if and only if the vertices belong to different partite sets.

If $|V_i| = n_i$ for $1 ≤ i ≤ k$, then $G$ is denoted by $K_{n_1,n_2,...,n_k}$

If $n_i = 1$ for all $i(1≤i≤k)$ ,then $G$ is the [[Complete graph|complete graph]]  $K_k$.

> [!tip] A complete multipartite graph 
is a complete $k$-partite graph for some integer $k ≥ 2$

Question_eng: A complete $k$-partite graph $G$ 
Question_rus: 
Answer_eng: is a $k$[[Multipartite Graphs|-partite graph]] with the property that two vertices are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in $G$ if and only if the vertices belong to different partite sets.
If $|V_i| = n_i$ for $1 ≤ i ≤ k$, then $G$ is denoted by $K_{n_1,n_2,...,n_k}$
If $n_i = 1$ for all $i(1≤i≤k)$ ,then $G$ is the [[Complete graph|complete graph]]  $K_k$.
