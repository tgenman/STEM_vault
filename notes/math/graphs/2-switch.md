Let $H$ be a graph containing four distinct vertices $u,v,w$ and $x$ such that $uv,wx ∈ E(H)$ and $uw,vx \not\in E(H)$

> [!tip] 2-switch in $H$
is process of deleting the edges $uv$ and $wx$ from $H$ and adding $uw$ and $vx$ to $H$

[[Theorem about 2-switches transformations of graphical sequence]]

One consequence of [[Theorem about 2-switches transformations of graphical sequence]] is that every two graphs with the same [[Degree Sequence|degree sequence]] are related in terms of [[2-switch]]es.
