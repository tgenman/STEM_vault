> [!tip] Isomorphic Graphs $G \cong H$
> Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if there exists a bijective function $φ : V (G) → V (H)$ such that two vertices $u$ and $v$ are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in $G$ if and only if $φ(u)$ and $φ(v)$ are adjacent in $H$.

> [!tip] Isomorphism $φ : V(G) → V(H)$
The function $φ$ is called an isomorphism from $G$ to $H$. 
If $φ : V(G) → V(H)$ is an isomorphism, then the inverse function $φ^{−1} :V(H)→V(G)$ is an isomorphism from $H$ to $G$.
