> [!tip] $u − v$ walk $W$ 
For two (not necessarily distinct) vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph $G$, a $u − v$ walk $W$ in $G$ is a sequence of vertices in $G$, beginning with $u$ and ending at $v$ such that consecutive vertices in $W$ are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in $G$.

> [!tip] length of W
The number of edges encountered in $W$ (including multiplicities)  .

$$W_1 = (x,w,y,w,v,u,w)$$

> [!tip] Equal Walks
Two $u−v$ walks $W =(u=u_0,u_1,...,u_k =v)$ and $W′ =(u=v_0,v_1,...,v_l = v)$  in a graph are equal if $k=l$ and $u_i =v_i$ for all $i$ with $0≤i≤k$
