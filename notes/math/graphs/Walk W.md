> [!tip] ${} u − v {}$ walk $W {}$ 
For two (not necessarily distinct) vertices ${} u {}$ and $v {}$ in a graph $G$, a ${} u − v {}$ walk $W {}$ in $G {}$ is a sequence of vertices in $G {}$, beginning with $u {}$ and ending at $v {}$ such that consecutive vertices in $W {}$ are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in $G {}$.

> [!tip] length of W
The number of edges encountered in $W$ (including multiplicities)  .

$$W_1 = (x,w,y,w,v,u,w)$$
