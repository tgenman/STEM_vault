> [!tip] A graph $G$ is self-complementary
if $G$ is isomorphic to $\bar{G}$.

if $G$ is a self-complementary graph of order $n$, 
then its size is $m = \binom n2 / 2 = n(n − 1)/4$.

Since only one of $n$ and $n − 1$ is even, either $4 | n$ or $4 | (n − 1)$; 
that is, if $G$ is a self-complementary graph of order $n$, then either $n ≡ 0(\mod 4)$ or $n ≡ 1 (\mod 4)$
