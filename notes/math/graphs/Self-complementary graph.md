> [!tip] A graph ${} G {}$ is self-complementary
if ${} G$ is isomorphic to ${} \bar{G}$.

if $G$ is a self-complementary graph of order $n {}$, 
then its size is ${} m = \binom n2 / 2 = n(n − 1)/4 {}$.

Since only one of $n$ and $n − 1$ is even, either $4 | n$ or $4 | (n − 1)$; 
that is, if $G$ is a self-complementary graph of order $n$, then either ${} n ≡ 0(\mod 4) {}$ or ${} n ≡ 1 (\mod 4) {}$
