- A ==discrete random variable== is a real-valued function of the outcome of the [[Random experiment|experiment]]  that can take a finite or countably infinite number of values.
- A discrete random variable has an associated [[PMF - p_X(x)]], which gives the probability of each numerical value that the ==random variable== can take.
- A function of a ==discrete random variable== defines another ==discrete random variable==, whose [[PMF - p_X(x)|PMF]] can be obtained from the [[PMF - p_X(x)|PMF]]  of the original ==random variable==.
