> [!tip] Kurtosis 
(from Greek: κυρτός, kyrtos or kurtos, meaning "curved, arching") 
is a measure of the "tailedness" of the [[Distribution of r.v. MOC|probability distribution]] of a real-valued random variable.

$\text{Kurt}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right] = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu)^4]}{(\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu)^2])^2} = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4}$

(from Greek: κυρτός, kyrtos or kurtos, meaning "curved, arching") 
is a measure of the "tailedness" of the [[Distribution of r.v. MOC|probability distribution]] of a real-valued random variable.
FORMULA: $\text{Kurt}[X] = \mathbb{E}\left[\left(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^4\right] = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu)^4]}{(\mathbb{E}[(X - \mu)^2])^2} = \frac{\mu_4}{\sigma^4}$
