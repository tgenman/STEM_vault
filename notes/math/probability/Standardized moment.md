standardized moment 
is a moment that has been normalized to be dimensionless.

Standardized moments are particularly useful for describing the shape characteristics of a distribution, such as skewness and kurtosis.

$\mu_k = E\left[\left(\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^k\right]$

For example:
- The **first standardized moment** is always 0 because it represents the mean of the standardized variable, which is zero by definition.
- The **second standardized moment** is always 1, as it represents the variance of a variable that has been standardized (the standard deviation of a standardized variable is 1).
- The **third standardized moment** is  [[Skewness (3)]]
- The **fourth standardized moment** is  [[Kurtosis (4) Kurt(X)]]
