> [!tip] Conditional independence
Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be conditionally independent, given another event $C$ with $P(C) > 0$, if
$P(A \cap B | C) = P(A | C)P(B | C)$

If in addition, $P(B \cap C) > 0$, conditional independence is equivalent to the condition $P(A | B \cap C) = P(A | C)$
