**Exponents** let us express repeated multiplication, making it easier to represent some quantities.

Product Rule for Exponents
When **multiplying** powers of the same base, we can **add** the exponents.

Quotient Rule for Exponents
When **dividing** powers of the same base, we can **subtract** the exponents.

Raising a product to a power is equivalent to raising each factor to that power.

Raising a quotient to a power is equivalent to raising the numerator and denominator to that power.

Raising a power to a power is equivalent to raising the base to the product of the powers.
