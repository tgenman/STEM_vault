> [!tip] Equality Relation
Let $S$ be any set. We can define an ==Equality Relation== $=$ between $S$ and itself as the subset $\set{(x, x) | x ∈ S}$.

So if $x, y ∈ S$ are different elements, then they are not related by the equality relation and we write $x  \neq y$, but if $x$ and $y$ are the same then we write $x = y$.

We will refer to any relation between a set $S$ and itself, as in the preceding example, as a ==relation on== $S$.

Any ==Equality Relation== is [[Equivalence Relation]]
