vector space $V'$ is a **subspace** of a [[Vector space V]] if
-   $V′$ is a vector space;
-   every element of $V'$ is also an element of $V$.

All we need is
-   $0$ is in $V′$;
-   for all $u, w \in V'$, $u + w \in V'$;
-   for all $v \in V'$, $cv \in V'$ for any constant $c$.

==**intersection** of two vector spaces==  $V∩W$, is exactly what you’d expect: the set of vectors that are in both $V$ and $W$.  [[Intersection of Sets (A ∩ B)]]
 
==**sum** of two vector spaces== , written $V⊕W$, is slightly trickier: the set of vectors $v+w$, where $v∈V$ and $w∈W$. 
 
==**union** of two vector spaces==, written $V∪W$ is the set of vectors in either $V$ or $W$  [[Union of Sets (A U B)]]
