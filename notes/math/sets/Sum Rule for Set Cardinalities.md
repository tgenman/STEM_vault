> [!tip] Sum Rule for Set Cardinalities
> The [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of a union of two [[Disjoint set|disjoint sets]] equals the sum of their cardinalities:
> $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$ where $A \cap B = \emptyset$

For non-disjoint sets, use the [[Inclusion-Exclusion principle]].

This is a special case of [[The additional principle (combinatorics)]].
