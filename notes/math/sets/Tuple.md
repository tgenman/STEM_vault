> [!tip] Tuple $(a_1,...,a_n)$
> is a finite ordered sequence of elements where the order matters and repetitions are allowed

> [!tip] Ordered pair $(a,b)$
> is a tuple of length 2

# Properties
- A tuple of length 2 is called an **ordered pair**
- The Cartesian power $A^n$ of a set $A$ is the set of all tuples of length $n$ with elements from $A$
- Elements in a tuple can repeat (unlike in sets)
- The order of elements matters (unlike in sets)
- The length of a tuple is fixed

# Related Concepts
- In different contexts, tuples may be referred to as:
  - [[Vector|Vectors]] (in linear algebra)
  - [[Arrangements without repetition|Arrangements]] (in combinatorics)
  - Finite sequences
  - Words (in formal languages)
