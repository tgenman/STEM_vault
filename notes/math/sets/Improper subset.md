> is either the empty set $\emptyset$ or the set $A$ itself.

# Properties
- Every set has exactly two improper subsets
- Improper subsets are the opposite of [[Proper subset|proper subsets]]
- For any set $A$:
    - $\emptyset \subseteq A$ (empty set is an improper subset)
    - $A \subseteq A$ (the set itself is an improper subset)
