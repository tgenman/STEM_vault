> [!tip] Nullary arity
> is a property of a function, operation, or relation that takes zero arguments.

For a function $f$, if it takes no arguments, we say it has arity 0 or is nullary: $f: \{\emptyset\} \to B$.

# Types and Examples

## Nullary Operation
![[Nullary Operation#Examples]]

## Nullary Relation
![[Nullary Relation#Examples]]

# Properties
1. They are always constant functions
2. They serve as identity elements in some contexts
3. They are independent of any input variables
