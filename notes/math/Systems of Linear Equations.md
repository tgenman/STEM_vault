### Solution Set 
- A _solution_ of a system of equations is a list of numbers x,y,z,... that make all of the equations true simultaneously.
- The _solution set_ of a system of equations is the collection of all solutions.
- _Solving_ the system means finding all solutions with formulas involving some number of parameters.
A system of equations is called _inconsistent_ if it has no solutions. It is called _consistent_ otherwise.



### Solution Methods

$$A⋅X=B$$
$$A^{−1}A⋅X=A^{−1}B⇔EX=A^{−1}B⇔X=A^{−1}B$$
