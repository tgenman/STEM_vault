> [!tip] Minimum Generating Set
A generating set $S$ of a group $G$ 
is a minimum generating set if $|S| \leq |T|$ for every generating set $T$ of $G$. 
In other words, it is a generating set of smallest possible [[Cardinality|cardinality]] .

TITLE: Minimum Generating Set
DESCRIPTION: A generating set $S$ of a group $G$ is a minimum generating set if $|S| \leq |T|$ for every generating set $T$ of $G$. In other words, it is a generating set of smallest possible cardinality.
FORMULA: 
ADDITIONAL: Example: In the hexagon symmetry group, $\langle r, f \rangle$ is a minimum (and hence minimal) generating set.
