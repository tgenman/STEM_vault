> [!tip] Definition
Addition is a binary operation that combines two elements from a set to produce another element of the same set.

# Properties
- **Commutative**: $a + b = b + a$
- **Associative**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
- **Identity Element**: There exists an element $0$ such that $a + 0 = a$ for any element $a$.
- **Inverse Element**: For each element $a$, there exists an element $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.
