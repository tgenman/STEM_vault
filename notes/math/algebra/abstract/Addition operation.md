> [!tip] Addition
Addition is a binary operation that combines two elements from a set to produce another element of the same set, often forming the basis of algebraic structures such as [[Group|groups]], [[Ring|rings]], and [[Field|fields]].

# Properties
- **[[Commutative identity]]**: $a + b = b + a$
- **[[Associative identity]]**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
- **[[Identity element]]**: There exists an element $0$ such that $a + 0 = a$ for any element $a$.
- **[[Inverse element]]**: For each element $a$, there exists an element $-a$ such that $a + (-a) = 0$.

TITLE: Addition
DESCRIPTION: Addition is a binary operation that combines two elements from a set to produce another element of the same set, forming the basis of algebraic structures like [[Group|groups]], [[Ring|rings]], and [[Field|fields]].
FORMULA: 
$a + b = b + a$ (Commutative), 
$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ (Associative), 
$a + 0 = a$ (Identity element),
$a + (-a) = 0$ (Inverse element)
