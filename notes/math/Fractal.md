as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose "Hausdorff dimension" is greater than its "topological dimenion".

- Fractals are shapes with a non-integer dimension.
- A fractal is a pattern where similar patterns appear at all smaller scales as you zoom in.

### Examples:
- [[Mandelbrot set]]
- [[Koch snowflake]]
- [[Sierpinski Triangle]]
- [[Julia set fractal]]



[ðŸ“¼ Fractals are typically not self-similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDN52m7Y21ePrTbvXkPaWVSg&index=16)
