We can also use the **coefficient of determination** $R^2$ to measure how close data are to a fitted regression line.

If $R^2=1$, then the data are perfectly fitted to the line. 
If $R^2=0$, the data is not fitted to the line.

Expressed as a decimal, $0.33$, the reduction in MSE is called the **coefficient of determination** and written $R^2$.

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{SST}
$$

SSR - [[Mean squared error|Sum of squared residuals SSR]]
SST - [[Total Sum of Squares (TSS or SST)]]
