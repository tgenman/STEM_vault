==**mode**== which is the value in a data set that occurs most frequently.

Unlike [[Median]] and [[Expected Value E(X)]], mode is also useful in evaluating data sets that contain non-numerical values.

A distribution is considered ==**bimodal**== when it has two peaks, even if the peaks do not have identical heights.


The mode is useful for several things:

- identifying the most common item in sets which cannot be evaluated numerically
    
- identifying the presence of “lurking variables” in our data that give rise to bimodal distributions
    
- finding the most common value in a set, which tells us something about what a “typical” value might be
