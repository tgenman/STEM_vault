Charts
- **Bar charts**¬†are great for comparing two similar categories, while¬†
- **pie charts**¬†are more useful for comparing one or several categories to the total.
- **scatter plot**
- **histogram**
- the line graph
- box and whisker plot, or boxplot

An ordered sequence of values taken at equally spaced time points in time is called a¬†**time series**.
A¬†**trend**¬†is the general, long-term pattern of a time series.

Suppose we observe pairs of data $(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$. 
Perhaps $X_i$ is the blood pressure of subject $i$ and $Y_i$ is how long they live. 
$X$ is called a predictor or regressor or feature or independent variable. 
$Y$ is called the outcome or the response variable or the dependent variable. 

We call $r(x) = \mathbb{E}[Y|X = x]$ the regression function. 

If we assume that $r \in \mathcal{F}$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is finite dimensional ‚Äî the set of straight lines for example ‚Äî then we have a parametric regression model. 
If we assume that $r \in \mathcal{F}$ where $\mathcal{F}$ is not finite dimensional then we have a nonparametric regression model. 

The goal of predicting $Y$ for a new patient based on their $X$ value is called prediction. 
If $Y$ is discrete (for example, live or die) then prediction is instead called classification. [[Classification (machine learning)]]

If our goal is to estimate the function $r$, then we call this regression or curve estimation. Regression models are sometimes written as
