# RL Exam Topics

1. Markov decision process and its properties. Reward, discounted reward.
2. What is a Q-function and a Value-function? Relationship between them.
3. How can RL be applied to NLP or CV tasks?
4. Exploration-exploitation tradeoff
5. Value-based vs. Policy based methods (general idea)
6. What is the difference between model-based and model-free RL?

# RL Key Concepts

- Action
- Agent
- Agent and Environment

- Environment
- Environment State
- Fully Observable Environments
- History
- Markov Decision process (MDP)
- Markov Property
- Markov state
- Model
- Observation
- Partially Observable Environments
- Partially observable Markov Decision Process (PoMDP)
- Policy
- Q-function
- Relationship Between V-function and Q-function
- Reward function
- Reward Hypothesis
- State
- Transition function
- V-function
