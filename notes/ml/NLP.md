TITLE: Embedding  
DESCRIPTION: A method for representing objects as dense vectors in a lower-dimensional space, where their similarity or semantic relationships are reflected by the proximity of their vectors. It is used to convert complex data into numerical formats.  
FORMULA: A vector of dimension ddd, where ddd is smaller than the number of categories. Example: "king" → [0.25,−0.64,0.13], "queen" → [0.26,−0.63,0.14].  
ADDITIONAL: Applied in NLP (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), recommendation systems, and computer vision. Advantage: compactness and ability to model relationships between objects. Limitation: requires large datasets for training.
