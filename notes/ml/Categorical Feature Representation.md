Methods for processing categorical data that do not have a natural numerical format
- [[One-hot Encoding]]
- **Label Encoding**: Assigns a unique integer to each category.
- **Target Encoding**: Replaces categories with the mean of the target variable for each category.
- **Binary Encoding**: Converts categories into binary representations.
- **Frequency Encoding**: Encodes categories based on their frequency in the dataset.
- **Hashing Encoding**: Maps categories into a fixed number of columns using a hashing function.
- **Ordinal Encoding**: Encodes ordered categories as integers.
- **Count Encoding**: Uses the count of each category in the dataset.
- **Probability Ratio Encoding**: Encodes categories based on the ratio of positive to negative outcomes.
- [[Embeddings]]
