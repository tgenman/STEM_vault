> [!tip] A complete $k$-partite graph $G {}$ 
is a $k {}$[[Multipartite Graphs|-partite graph]] with the property that two vertices are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] in ${} G$ if and only if the vertices belong to different partite sets.

If $|V_i| = n_i {}$ for $1 ≤ i ≤ k$, then $G$ is denoted by ${} K_{n_1,n_2,...,n_k} {}$

If ${} n_i = 1 {}$ for all $i(1≤i≤k) {}$ ,then $G {}$ is the [[Complete graph|complete graph]]  ${} K_k {}$.

> [!tip] A complete multipartite graph 
is a complete ${} k$-partite graph for some integer $k ≥ 2$
