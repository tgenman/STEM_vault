> Every graph has an even number of odd vertices.

### Proof
Proof. Suppose that $G$ is a graph of size $m {}$. By [[The First Theorem of Graph Theory]],
$$\sum_{v\in V(G)}\deg v=2m.$$
which, of course, is an even number. Since the sum of the degrees of the even vertices of ${} G$ is even, the sum of the degrees of the odd vertices of $G$ must be even as well, implying that $G$ has an even number of odd vertices.
