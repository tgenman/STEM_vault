> [!tip] A graph ${} G$ is a $k {}$-partite graph ($k \in N$ ${} k â‰¥ 1$)
if ${} V(G)$ can be partitioned into $k$ subsets ${} V_1, V_2, . . . , V_k {}$ ( called partite sets) such that every edge of $G {}$ joins vertices in two different partite sets.

A $1 {}$-partite graph is then an [[Empty graph]] empty graph 
A ${} 2 {}$-partite graph is [[Bipartite graph]].
