> [!tip] The complement ${} \bar{G}$ of a graph G 
is that graph with vertex set ${} V(G) {}$ such that two vertices are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] adjacent in ${} \bar{G} {}$ if and only if these vertices are not adjacent in $G {}$.

Any [[Isomorphic Graphs|isomorphism]] from a graph $G {}$ to a graph $H$ is also an isomorphism from ${} \bar{G} {}$ to $\bar{H} {}$. 
Consequently, ${} \bar{G} \not \cong \bar{H} {}$ if and only if ${} G \not \cong H {}$.

If $G {}$ is a graph of order $n {}$ and size $m {}$, then ${} \bar{G} {}$ is a graph of order $n {}$ and size $\binom n2 - m {}$. 

The complement ${} K_n {}$ of the complete graph Kn is the [[Empty graph|empty graph]] of order $n$.
