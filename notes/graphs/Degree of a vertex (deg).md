### Definition
> [!tip] Degree of a vertex ${} v {}$ in a graph $G {}$
 > - is the number of vertices that are [[Adjacent in graph|adjacent]] to ${} v {}$. 
 > - is the number of vertices in its [[Neighbourhood in graph (N)|neighborhood]] $N(v) {}$. 
 > - is the number of edges incident with $v$.

$$\deg v = |N(v)|$$
### Types vertex by degree
- ${} \deg v = 0 {}$ - [[Isolated vertex]]
- ${} \deg v = 1 {}$ - [[End-vertex]]
- [[Even and Odd Vertices]]
	- [[Number of odd vertices (corollary)]]

### Types degree in graph
- [[Maximum degree]]
- [[Minimum degree]]


$$0 ≤ δ(G) ≤ \deg v ≤ ∆(G) ≤ n − 1$$
