A special type of relation $↔$ between $X$ and $Y$ called a ==one-to-one correspondence==. Since each element $x$ of $X$ appears precisely once in this relation, we can regard this one-to-one correspondence as a function with [[Domain of a function]] $X$. 
The [[Range of the function]]  is $Y$ because each $y$ in $Y$ also appears in some pairing $x ↔ y$.
