United States Air Force Colonel [[üë§Boyd, John]] was a fighter pilot and theorist who developed a model of decisionmaking called the OODA loop.

Essentially, Colonel Boyd‚Äôs theory was that people are constantly looping through the same four steps as they interact with their environment:

-   **Observe** ‚Äî Sometimes also called the ‚Äúnotice‚Äù step, this is the point at which you become aware of something which might require your attention. For a fighter pilot, this might be a flash of light on the horizon. For everyday life, this might be something like hearing a crash come from the kitchen, or seeing an expression flicker across your partner‚Äôs face.
-   **Orient** ‚Äî This is the point at which you frame your observation, and decide how you will relate to it. Is this a problem to solve? A threat to avoid? Something unimportant that you can dismiss?
-   **Decide** ‚Äî This is the point at which you formulate a plan. What will you do, given the ongoing situation? How will you respond?
-   **Act** ‚Äî This is the point at which thinking pauses (until your next observation) and you move toward executing the plan you‚Äôve already formed.

Sometimes, an OODA loop can be lightning fast, as when you catch motion out of the corner of your eye and duck before the baseball can hit you. Other times, it can be quite drawn out‚Äîthink deciding which college to attend, or dealing with a persistent relationship problem.

Boyd‚Äôs key insight was that you could disrupt the decisionmaking of oth- ers, by preventing their OODA loops from resolving or completing. As both a fighter pilot and a teacher of fighter pilots, Boyd advocated doing things like spacing out confusing stimuli‚Äîpresent the enemy with one observation, and then, while they‚Äôre trying to orient, present them with another conflict- ing observation, so that they never quite make it to the decide and act steps, and remain confused and disoriented until you shoot them down.

==At CFAR, we‚Äôve found it useful to think deliberately about what step of the OODA loop you are on, given a specific [[Bug]] or problem. ==Often, attempts to help a friend with their problem fall flat, because they‚Äôre in the wrong step‚Äîthink any time that someone offered you solutions or advice too soon, before you were ready for it. ==A good question to ask yourself, before diving into a [[Debugging]] or pair [[Debugging]] session, is ‚Äúam I trying to orient, trying to decide, or trying to carry out a decision?‚Äù==
