==Heuristic== - A quick-and-dirty [[Decision making|decision-making]] or [[Problem Solving|problem-solving]] algorithm, sometimes inaccurate in specifics but useful for reaching approximate solutions with incomplete data or inadequate time. Heuristics may be more or less appropriate, depending on circumstances; the field of ‚Äúheuristics and biases‚Äù research takes a measured look at the ways in which our evolutionary history and brain structure cause us to make systematic, predictable mistakes. Much of CFAR‚Äôs content is concerned with identifying and repairing poor heuristics, and forming and leveraging useful ones. See ‚Äú[[Fermi Estimate]].‚Äù
