Взгляд со стороны

==Outside View== - The “common sense” view, as derived from base rates, past experience, and observations of similar phenomena. Often used as a check on “[[Inside View]],” such as when estimating the length of time required to complete a task; the [[Inside View]] asks “how long do I think this will take?” while the outside View asks “how long have things like this taken people like me, in the past?”
