==Hyperbolic Discounting== - An effect in operant conditioning and behavior modification whereby the proximity of punishment or reinforcement to the behavior being punished or reinforced has a disproportionately large impact on the speed and permanence of the behavior change. 
When providing (e.g.) a treat to a dog as a [[Reward function]] for doing a trick, the difference between a delay of a tenth of a second and a delay of half a second is highly significant, and much more significant than a difference of the same magnitude between one second and one-point-four seconds. This swift drop-off in efficacy is the justification for ‚Äúclicker training,‚Äù in which a _click_ is first associated with a tangible reward, and then used as the reinforcer‚Äîthe click can be delivered practically instantaneously, providing much stronger reinforcement than a tossed treat that takes half a second to arrive.
