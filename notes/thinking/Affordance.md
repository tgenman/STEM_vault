==Affordance== - An opportunity or potential-for-action arising from a given context; a door handle creates an _affordance_ for pulling. In particular, it is a _genuine_ or _felt_ opportunity—while there may be no physical difference between picking up a pen on one’s own desk, one’s coworker’s desk, one’s manager’s desk, or the CEO’s desk, each of those contexts provides a different degree of affordance.

An object’s (or environment’s) affordances for a person are the set of actions that the person readily perceives as possible. A person’s social comfort zone can be considered to be defined by the social affordances that they perceive.
