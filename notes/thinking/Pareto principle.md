80-20 - To ‚Äú80-20‚Äù something is to obtain most of the result (80%) with only a small proportion of the work (20%). This expression originates with the Pareto principle which states that for many events, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes (e.g. most of a company‚Äôs sales come from a small number of its clients).
