==Button Test== - A tool for eliciting [[System 1]] responses, in which one pretends that a given outcome can be achieved with the press of a button. By pretending that one is about to push the button, one often finds reasons to hesitate or notices previously unacknowledged factors or assumptions.

==Button test==: if he could push a button and get feedback for his students, measure his teaching effectiveness, [[Signaling|signal]] caring, [[Signaling|signal]] competence, and provide motivation, all without ever grading a single paper, would he do it? Would there be any reason to hesitate?
