==Declarative knowledge== — any sort of explicit information about the world or how it works; the sort of thing we can explain using words or pictures


==Declarative Knowledge== - A type of knowledge that one can directly communicate (“declare”), usually in words but also in diagrams or other explicit media. Facts one knows (e.g., “The capitol city of France is Paris”) are declarative knowledge, as are understandings that one can potentially express (e.g., the mathematical description of Newtonian gravity). One can have declarative knowledge of how to do something without being able to do it, such as knowing what’s involved in throwing a dart to hit a bullseye without having the skill. Contrast with “[[Procedural knowledge]].”
