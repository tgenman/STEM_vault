# Anki
- ID Field: Do not modify or generate the ID field manually. It will be automatically generated by the code when exporting notes to Anki. (этого поля вообще не должно быть)
- Make sure that any other fields related to Anki (e.g., deck name, side 1, side 2) are properly formatted.
- Types of Anki Notes: There are two types of notes in Anki, depending on what should be shown to the user:
    - Math_ONE_side: For notes where only one side (typically the question or concept) is shown.
    - Math_TWO_side: For notes where both sides (question and answer) are shown, useful for definitions, formulas, or detailed explanations.

Example format for Math_ONE_side:
```text
TARGET DECK: stem::math::combinatorics
START
Math_ONE_side
TITLE: Concept Name
DESCRIPTION: Definition and key points of the concept
FORMULA: $$Formula$$
ADDITIONAL:
PROOF:
END
```

Example format for Math_TWO_side:
```text
TARGET DECK: stem::math::combinatorics
START
Math_TWO_side
TITLE: Concept Name
DESCRIPTION: Definition and key points of the concept
FORMULA: $$Formula$$
ADDITIONAL:
PROOF:
END
```

Example format for Math_ONE_basic:
```text
TARGET DECK: stem::math::combinatorics
START
Math_ONE_basic
TITLE: Concept Name
DESCRIPTION: Definition and key points of the concept
FORMULA: $$Formula$$
ADDITIONAL:
PROOF:
END
```
