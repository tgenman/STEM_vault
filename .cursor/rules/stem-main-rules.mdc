I use this database as a personal study guide for mathematics and STEM subjects, which will serve me for decades. You are my genious assistant

- **Use English**: Notes should be in English for global reference consistency.
- **Clear Concepts**: Each note should define one concept with clear focus, following **single responsibility**, **low coupling**, and **high cohesion** principles.
  - **Single Responsibility**: One note, one concept to avoid confusion.
  - **Low Coupling**: Notes should be self-contained with minimal, relevant links to others.
  - **High Cohesion**: All elements should directly relate to the main idea.
- **Concept Properties & Relations**: Define key properties of each concept and its relationships to others using object-predicate-object format (e.g., "A permutation is a sequence of elements from set X").
- **Keep It Simple**: Prioritize clarity and brevity over technical jargon and unnecessary elaboration.
- **No Water**: Be direct and concise, without introductions or excessive background.
- **Organize Notes**: Use headings for better navigation.
- **Revise Older Notes**: Periodically update notes to follow the current format for uniformity.
- maximize the use of existing text in the note, if possible
- I am studying mathematics at the university. Donâ€™t explain very simple things
- **Interconnected Notes**: The notes form a graph through `[[Other concept]]` or `[[Other concept|alias]]` notation
    - Use search to find related concepts (parents, same type, children)
    - **Linking Strategy**: After creating a note, make a second pass to maximize connections:
      - Link key terms to existing notes instead of plain text
      - Reference related concepts rather than explaining them inline
      - Build semantic bridges between mathematical areas

# Notation
- **Markdown (.md)**: Notes in markdown format, stored in Obsidian.
- **Latex for Formulas**: Inline formulas with `$`, block formulas with `$$`. STRICTLY dont use `\(`for formulas
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use for visual explanation of concepts, relationships, or examples. Helps illustrate abstract mathematical ideas.
- **Definition**: The definition should come first, marked with a callout `> [!tip] ${{Definition_title}}`, and the main content should follow on the next line.
    - Second line after `> [!tip] ${{Definition_title_with_math_notation}}` should not contains definition title. Only debinition body itself. For example `> is an ordered ...`
    - Example: ```text
> [!tip] Difference of Sets $A \setminus B$ for sets $A$ and $B$
> is the set of elements that belong to $A$ but not to $B$.
$A \setminus B = \{x \in A | x \notin B\} = A \cap \overline{B}$
    ```
- **Front Matter**: Each note should start with essential metadata, including aliases, links, and tags.
    - **aliases**:
      - you should not translate aliases to english. it can be any
      - not add in aliase name of file (because filename already is main title)
    - **tags**: Don't use math section tags (`topology`, `calculus`, `algebra`, etc.) - use folder structure instead. Use content tags:
      - `content/definition`
      - `content/theorem` 
      - `content/lemma`
      - `content/example`
      - `content/algorithm`
      - `content/summary`
      - `content/application`
      - `content/moc`
    - **anki**: `true` if exists Anki block and else is `false`
